first you have two choices either you run this in your local host or your web database or create one at a free hosting site.


if you will run this on your local host then use the emurator android studio comes with

if you are using a phone you will need to host this on a database somewhere on the web to test ths piece of code

import the code run it in android studio if go into the code u will find places that have the urls u will need to change these accordingly

now there is another folder with the php code make changes also to those according to what you have setting for your server  the name..password..database..and table

for the database you can import the table i have give in the folder import it like so then enjoy hope it works


its a login system that uses prefered preferences to keeep the use in the system it use a session manager...ENJOY!!!!!!!
